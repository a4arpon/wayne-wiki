## Study Sheet: Latest Era System Design - Part 3 (Scaling Node.js for High-Load, Real-World Applications)

### 1. **Introduction to Scaling for High-Load Systems**
In **Part 3**, we focus on practical techniques to prepare a **Node.js** system for handling **millions of users** and **heavy traffic loads**. We will look at strategies for **horizontal scaling**, **database optimization**, **caching**, **rate limiting**, **performance monitoring**, and **disaster recovery**. The goal is to equip you with knowledge on designing resilient and scalable systems that perform optimally under real-world production loads.

### 2. **Horizontal Scaling in Node.js**

#### 2.1 **Horizontal Scaling Overview**
- **Horizontal scaling** refers to adding more servers to handle increasing loads rather than upgrading a single server’s hardware (vertical scaling).
  
#### 2.2 **Techniques for Horizontal Scaling**
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute incoming traffic across multiple Node.js instances.
  - Tools: **Nginx**, **HAProxy**, **AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**, **Google Cloud Load Balancer**.
  - Example: Nginx acts as a load balancer directing requests to several Node.js backend instances.
- **Node.js Cluster Module**: Allows utilizing multiple CPU cores by creating worker processes.
  ```javascript
  const cluster = require('cluster');
  const http = require('http');
  const numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;

  if (cluster.isMaster) {
      for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
          cluster.fork();
      }
  } else {
      http.createServer((req, res) => {
          res.writeHead(200);
          res.end('Hello World\n');
      }).listen(8000);
  }
  ```

#### 2.3 **Stateless Services**
- **Stateless architecture** ensures that any Node.js instance can serve any request, improving resilience and enabling scaling.
- **Session Management**: Store session data in an external store like **Redis** or a **database** rather than the server memory.

---

### 3. **Optimizing Databases for High Load**

#### 3.1 **Database Sharding**
- **Sharding** is the process of distributing data across multiple databases or machines to balance the load.
- **Horizontal Sharding**: Distribute rows of a table across multiple servers.
- **Vertical Sharding**: Split tables across different databases based on use case.

**Example:**
- In an e-commerce platform, you might store user-related data in one database shard and order-related data in another.

#### 3.2 **Database Indexing and Query Optimization**
- Use indexes to optimize read-heavy operations.
- Regularly profile and optimize slow queries.
- Tools like **pgAdmin** (for PostgreSQL) and **MongoDB Compass** help analyze query performance.

#### 3.3 **Read Replicas**
- Implement **read replicas** for databases to offload read requests from the primary database.
- Tools: **PostgreSQL Replication**, **MySQL Replication**, **MongoDB Replica Set**.

**Example**: 
- You could direct all write operations to the primary database while redirecting read operations (like search queries) to replicas.

### 4. **Caching Strategies for Performance Optimization**

#### 4.1 **Why Cache?**
- Caching helps reduce database load and improves response times by storing frequently requested data closer to the application layer.

#### 4.2 **Caching Layers**
- **Client-Side Caching**: Caching responses in the user’s browser using **HTTP headers** like `Cache-Control` and `ETag`.
- **CDN Caching**: Use **Content Delivery Networks** (e.g., **Cloudflare**, **AWS CloudFront**) to cache static assets like CSS, JS, and images at edge locations.
- **Application-Level Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data or API responses at the server level using **Redis** or **Memcached**.

**Example:**
- Cache popular API results in Redis with an expiry time of 60 seconds:
  ```javascript
  const redis = require('redis');
  const client = redis.createClient();

  app.get('/user/:id', async (req, res) => {
      const userId = req.params.id;
      client.get(userId, async (err, data) => {
          if (data) {
              return res.json(JSON.parse(data));
          } else {
              const user = await getUserFromDatabase(userId);
              client.setex(userId, 60, JSON.stringify(user));
              res.json(user);
          }
      });
  });
  ```

### 5. **Handling Spikes in Traffic with Rate Limiting and Circuit Breakers**

#### 5.1 **Rate Limiting**
- Rate limiting is a technique to control the number of requests a client can make to a server, preventing abuse and protecting against DDoS attacks.
- **Node.js Rate Limiting Libraries**: 
  - **express-rate-limit**: Middleware for rate limiting in Express apps.
  - Example:
  ```javascript
  const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

  const limiter = rateLimit({
      windowMs: 1 * 60 * 1000, // 1 minute
      max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  });

  app.use(limiter);
  ```

#### 5.2 **Circuit Breakers**
- Circuit breakers stop requests to a failing service and prevent overloading.
- Use libraries like **Opossum** in Node.js to implement circuit breakers.
- Example: Protect an external API by using a circuit breaker:
  ```javascript
  const CircuitBreaker = require('opossum');

  const options = {
      timeout: 5000,
      errorThresholdPercentage: 50,
      resetTimeout: 10000
  };

  const breaker = new CircuitBreaker(apiCall, options);
  
  breaker.fallback(() => ({ message: 'Service unavailable' }));
  breaker.fire()
      .then(response => console.log(response))
      .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
  ```

### 6. **Distributed Logging and Monitoring**

#### 6.1 **Centralized Logging**
- Use centralized logging systems to collect and analyze logs from all instances.
- **Node.js Logging Libraries**: 
  - **Winston** or **Pino** for logging structured data.
  - Use **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** or **Graylog** for real-time log aggregation and searching.

#### 6.2 **Performance Monitoring**
- **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)** tools like **New Relic**, **Datadog**, or **Prometheus** can be integrated with Node.js to track real-time metrics, including CPU, memory usage, request latency, and throughput.

**Example**: Monitoring Node.js CPU and memory usage:
```javascript
const os = require('os');
console.log('CPU Usage:', os.cpus());
console.log('Memory Usage:', process.memoryUsage());
```

### 7. **Disaster Recovery and Backup**

#### 7.1 **Data Backup Strategies**
- Ensure regular backups of critical databases and configurations. 
- Use **snapshotting** for databases like **MongoDB** and **PostgreSQL** or implement continuous backups via cloud providers.

#### 7.2 **Failover and Redundancy**
- **Active-Passive Failover**: Have a standby server ready to take over if the primary server fails.
- **Multi-Region Deployment**: Deploy services across multiple regions to ensure availability even during a regional outage (e.g., AWS regions).

**Example**: Deploy Node.js services in **AWS US-East-1** and **US-West-1** regions, using **Route 53** for automated failover between regions.

#### 7.3 **Disaster Recovery Plan**
- Establish a detailed **disaster recovery plan (DRP)**, outlining steps to restore service during a catastrophic event. This includes:
  - Fallback procedures
  - Backup testing and verification
  - Clear communication plans during downtime.

### 8. **Real-World High Load Application Preparation Checklist**

#### 8.1 **Pre-Deployment Checklist**
- **Scalability Testing**: Perform load tests using tools like **Artillery**, **JMeter**, or **Locust**.
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensure optimized database queries, proper caching mechanisms, and minimized API latency.
- **Security Audits**: Conduct vulnerability scans and penetration testing.
- **Monitoring Setup**: Ensure all services have centralized logging, error tracking, and performance monitoring enabled.
  
#### 8.2 **Post-Deployment Checklist**
- **Health Checks**: Automate periodic health checks of your services and databases.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment using tools like **Jenkins**, **CircleCI**, or **GitHub Actions**.
- **Auto-scaling Configurations**: Use auto-scaling rules on cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, etc.) to automatically handle traffic spikes.
