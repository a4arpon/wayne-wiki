# **Introduction to Linked Lists**

Hello! Let's explore **Linked Lists**, a fundamental data structure in computer science that's essential for efficient data manipulation and storage. We'll delve into both **singly** and **doubly linked lists**, understand how they work, and see how to implement them in JavaScript.

---

## **What Are Linked Lists?**

A **linked list** is a linear data structure where each element, called a **node**, contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements contiguously in memory, which allows for efficient insertions and deletions.

### **Real-World Analogy**

Imagine a treasure hunt where each clue (node) points you to the next location (node). You start at the first clue and follow the trail until you reach the end. Each clue knows only about the next one, not the entire path.

## **Why Use Linked Lists Over Arrays?**

### **Arrays**

- **Fixed Size**: Traditional arrays have a fixed size (not the case with JavaScript arrays, but important in other languages).
- **Contiguous Memory**: Elements are stored in consecutive memory locations.
- **Random Access**: You can access any element directly using its index.

### **Linked Lists**

- **Dynamic Size**: Can grow or shrink during runtime.
- **Non-Contiguous Memory**: Nodes can be scattered in memory.
- **Sequential Access**: You have to traverse from the head to access a particular node.

**Use Case:** Linked lists are ideal when you need efficient insertions and deletions, especially at the beginning or middle of the list, without the overhead of shifting elements as in arrays.

## **Singly Linked Lists**

In a **singly linked list**, each node contains:

- **Data**: The value or information.
- **Next Pointer**: A reference to the next node in the list.

### **Structure of a Node**

```javascript
class Node {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.next = null;
  }
}
```

### **Basic Operations**

#### **1. Creating a Linked List**

Let's build a linked list that stores numbers.

```javascript
class LinkedList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null;
  }
}
```

- **`head`**: The first node in the list.

#### **2. Inserting Nodes**

**a. At the Beginning**

```javascript
insertAtHead(data) {
  const newNode = new Node(data);
  newNode.next = this.head;
  this.head = newNode;
}
```

**b. At the End**

```javascript
insertAtTail(data) {
  const newNode = new Node(data);
  if (!this.head) {
    this.head = newNode;
    return;
  }
  let current = this.head;
  while (current.next) {
    current = current.next;
  }
  current.next = newNode;
}
```

#### **3. Traversing the List**

```javascript
printList() {
  let current = this.head;
  while (current) {
    console.log(current.data);
    current = current.next;
  }
}
```

#### **4. Deleting Nodes**

**a. Deleting a Node with a Given Value**

```javascript
deleteWithValue(data) {
  if (!this.head) return;

  if (this.head.data === data) {
    this.head = this.head.next;
    return;
  }

  let current = this.head;
  while (current.next && current.next.data !== data) {
    current = current.next;
  }

  if (current.next) {
    current.next = current.next.next;
  }
}
```

---

### **Example Usage**

```javascript
const list = new LinkedList();
list.insertAtHead(10);
list.insertAtHead(20);
list.insertAtTail(30);
list.printList();
// Output:
// 20
// 10
// 30

list.deleteWithValue(10);
list.printList();
// Output:
// 20
// 30
```

---

## **Doubly Linked Lists**

A **doubly linked list** extends the singly linked list by adding a **previous pointer** to each node.

### **Structure of a Node**

```javascript
class Node {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.next = null;
    this.prev = null;
  }
}
```

### **Basic Operations**

#### **1. Creating a Doubly Linked List**

```javascript
class DoublyLinkedList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null;
    this.tail = null;
  }
}
```

- **`head`**: The first node.
- **`tail`**: The last node.

#### **2. Inserting Nodes**

**a. At the Beginning**

```javascript
insertAtHead(data) {
  const newNode = new Node(data);
  if (!this.head) {
    this.head = this.tail = newNode;
    return;
  }
  newNode.next = this.head;
  this.head.prev = newNode;
  this.head = newNode;
}
```

**b. At the End**

```javascript
insertAtTail(data) {
  const newNode = new Node(data);
  if (!this.tail) {
    this.head = this.tail = newNode;
    return;
  }
  newNode.prev = this.tail;
  this.tail.next = newNode;
  this.tail = newNode;
}
```

#### **3. Traversing the List**

**a. Forward Traversal**

```javascript
printForward() {
  let current = this.head;
  while (current) {
    console.log(current.data);
    current = current.next;
  }
}
```

**b. Backward Traversal**

```javascript
printBackward() {
  let current = this.tail;
  while (current) {
    console.log(current.data);
    current = current.prev;
  }
}
```

#### **4. Deleting Nodes**

**a. Deleting a Node with a Given Value**

```javascript
deleteWithValue(data) {
  if (!this.head) return;

  if (this.head.data === data) {
    this.head = this.head.next;
    if (this.head) this.head.prev = null;
    else this.tail = null;
    return;
  }

  let current = this.head;
  while (current && current.data !== data) {
    current = current.next;
  }

  if (current) {
    current.prev.next = current.next;
    if (current.next) {
      current.next.prev = current.prev;
    } else {
      this.tail = current.prev;
    }
  }
}
```

---

### **Example Usage**

```javascript
const dList = new DoublyLinkedList();
dList.insertAtHead(10);
dList.insertAtTail(20);
dList.insertAtTail(30);

dList.printForward();
// Output:
// 10
// 20
// 30

dList.printBackward();
// Output:
// 30
// 20
// 10

dList.deleteWithValue(20);
dList.printForward();
// Output:
// 10
// 30
```

## **Real-World Scenarios and Applications**

- **Browser History Management**: Navigating back and forth through visited pages.
- **Music Playlist**: Moving to the next or previous song.
- **Undo/Redo Functionality**: In text editors or drawing applications.
- **Implementing Queues and Stacks**: With efficient insertions and deletions.

---

## **Advantages and Disadvantages**

### **Advantages**

- **Efficient Insertions/Deletions**: Especially in the middle of the list.
- **Dynamic Size**: Can grow or shrink at runtime.
- **Memory Utilization**: Allocates memory as needed.

### **Disadvantages**

- **No Random Access**: Cannot access nodes directly by index.
- **Extra Memory Overhead**: Additional pointers increase memory usage.
- **Traversal Required**: To access or search for elements.

---

## **Key Differences Between Singly and Doubly Linked Lists**

- **Memory Usage**: Doubly linked lists use more memory due to the extra `prev` pointer.
- **Traversal**: Doubly linked lists can be traversed in both directions.
- **Complexity**: Operations like deletion are more straightforward in doubly linked lists because you have direct access to the previous node.

---

## **Practical Tips for Implementation**

- **Edge Cases**: Always consider empty lists, single-node lists, and updates to `head` and `tail` pointers.
- **Testing**: Thoroughly test insertion, deletion, and traversal methods.
- **Visualization**: Drawing diagrams can help understand how nodes are linked.

## **Exercises to Reinforce Learning**

1. **Implement a Function to Reverse a Singly Linked List**

   - Traverse the list and reverse the `next` pointers.
   - Update the `head` pointer at the end.

   ```javascript
   reverse() {
     let current = this.head;
     let prev = null;
     while (current) {
       let nextNode = current.next;
       current.next = prev;
       prev = current;
       current = nextNode;
     }
     this.head = prev;
   }
   ```

2. **Find the Middle Element of a Linked List**

   - Use two pointers: a slow pointer and a fast pointer.
   - The slow pointer moves one node at a time, while the fast pointer moves two nodes.

   ```javascript
   findMiddle() {
     let slow = this.head;
     let fast = this.head;
     while (fast && fast.next) {
       slow = slow.next;
       fast = fast.next.next;
     }
     console.log('Middle Element:', slow.data);
   }
   ```

3. **Detect a Cycle in a Linked List**

   - Again, use the slow and fast pointer technique.
   - If they meet, there's a cycle.

   ```javascript
   hasCycle() {
     let slow = this.head;
     let fast = this.head;
     while (fast && fast.next) {
       slow = slow.next;
       fast = fast.next.next;
       if (slow === fast) return true;
     }
     return false;
   }
   ```
