Functional Requirements

#### Backend API:
1. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement user registration with email verification.
   - Set up login functionality with JWT or OAuth.
   - Provide password reset and account recovery options.

2. **CRUD Operations for NFTs**:
   - **Create NFT**:
     - Allow users to mint new NFTs by uploading metadata (e.g., images, descriptions).
   - **Read NFT**:
     - Provide endpoints to fetch details of individual NFTs.
     - Implement search and filter functionality for browsing NFTs.
   - **Update NFT**:
     - Allow users to update NFT metadata (e.g., description) if applicable.
   - **Delete NFT**:
     - Implement functionality to delist or remove NFTs from the marketplace.

3. **Transaction Processing**:
   - **Buy NFT**:
     - Implement purchase functionality with payment options (cryptocurrency or fiat).
     - Handle transaction confirmation and update NFT ownership.
   - **Sell NFT**:
     - Allow users to list NFTs for sale with pricing options.
     - Provide an auction or fixed-price sale model.

4. **Integration with Ethereum Blockchain**:
   - **Smart Contract Interaction**:
     - Interact with deployed smart contracts to mint, transfer, and query NFTs.
   - **Transaction Management**:
     - Handle blockchain transaction confirmations and updates.

#### Smart Contracts:
1. **NFT Minting**:
   - Write Solidity contracts for creating and minting NFTs.
   - Ensure contract functions handle minting with unique token IDs.

2. **NFT Transfer**:
   - Develop functions for transferring NFTs between users.
   - Implement ownership verification and transfer validation.

3. **NFT Querying**:
   - Create functions to query NFT details and ownership information.
   - Implement event logging for contract actions.

4. **Contract Deployment**:
   - Deploy smart contracts on the Ethereum network using Infura.
   - Test deployment on testnets before mainnet deployment.

#### Blockchain Interaction:
1. **Set Up Infura**:
   - Configure Infura to connect your application with the Ethereum blockchain.
   - Set up Web3 provider with Infura credentials.

2. **Handle Blockchain Events**:
   - Monitor and respond to blockchain events (e.g., NFT transfers, new listings).
   - Implement event listeners and handlers in the backend.

3. **Manage Transactions**:
   - Process and record blockchain transactions in the backend.
   - Implement mechanisms for transaction retries and error handling.

#### Data Handling:
1. **Design Data Models**:
   - Create database schemas for users, NFTs, and transaction history.
   - Define relationships between users, NFTs, and transactions.

2. **Fetch NFT Data**:
   - Retrieve NFT data from the blockchain and store it in the database.
   - Implement caching or indexing to optimize data retrieval.

3. **Store Transaction Data**:
   - Record transaction details (e.g., buyer, seller, amount) in the database.
   - Ensure data consistency between blockchain and database.

#### Error Handling:
1. **API Errors**:
   - Implement error responses for invalid requests or failed operations.
   - Provide meaningful error messages and status codes.

2. **Blockchain Errors**:
   - Handle errors related to smart contract interactions and blockchain transactions.
   - Implement retry logic for failed blockchain operations.
