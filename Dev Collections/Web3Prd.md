Hereâ€™s the updated PRD with the assigned scope for an NFT marketplace:

### 1. Introduction
   - **Purpose**: Develop an NFT marketplace where users can mint, buy, sell, and trade NFTs (non-fungible tokens). The platform will enable users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain through a backend built with FastAPI, Solidity for smart contracts, and Infura for blockchain access.

### 2. Project Overview
   - **Summary**: The application will provide a marketplace for NFT transactions. Users will be able to create accounts, browse available NFTs, mint new NFTs, and conduct transactions securely. 
   - **Key Features**:
     - User registration and authentication
     - NFT minting and listing
     - NFT browsing and searching
     - Buying and selling NFTs
     - Transaction history
     - User profiles
   - **Target Users**: NFT collectors, creators, and traders.

### 3. Functional Requirements
   - **Backend API**:
     - User authentication (sign-up, login, password reset)
     - CRUD operations for NFTs
     - Transaction processing
     - Integration with Ethereum blockchain for NFT transactions
   - **Smart Contracts**:
     - Smart contracts for minting, transferring, and querying NFTs.
     - Contract deployment on Ethereum via Infura.
   - **Blockchain Interaction**:
     - Integrate Infura to communicate with the Ethereum network.
     - Handle blockchain events and transactions.
   - **Data Handling**:
     - Design data models for users, NFTs, and transactions.
     - Fetch and store NFT data from the blockchain.
   - **Error Handling**:
     - Manage errors in API interactions and blockchain transactions.

### 4. Non-Functional Requirements
   - **Performance**:
     - Fast response times for API requests.
     - Efficient handling of blockchain transactions.
   - **Security**:
     - Secure user data and transaction details.
     - Protect private keys and sensitive blockchain interactions.
   - **Scalability**:
     - Support growing numbers of users and transactions.
   - **Reliability**:
     - Implement robust monitoring and alerting.

### 5. Technical Architecture
   - **Backend**:
     - FastAPI setup for handling API requests.
     - Database design for users and NFTs.
   - **Smart Contracts**:
     - Solidity for NFT contract development.
   - **Blockchain Integration**:
     - Infura for Ethereum blockchain interaction.
   - **Deployment**:
     - Strategy for deploying the backend and smart contracts.

### 6. User Interface (UI)
   - **API Documentation**:
     - Provide comprehensive API documentation via Swagger UI.
   - **Frontend Integration**:
     - Describe how the frontend will interact with the backend API.

### 7. Development and Testing
   - **Development Plan**:
     - Outline project milestones and timeline.
   - **Testing Strategy**:
     - Unit and integration tests for backend functionality.
     - Smart contract testing and validation.
     - End-to-end testing for marketplace features.

### 8. Deployment and Maintenance
   - **Deployment**:
     - Steps for deploying backend services and smart contracts.
   - **Maintenance Plan**:
     - Regular monitoring and support.
     - Updates and bug fixes.
